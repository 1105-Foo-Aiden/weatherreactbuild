#Peer Review: Website is not formatted in a way that is easy to follow. Design could use a lot of work. Code itself looks good, I like the use of the component for the forecast data! Its giving me some ideas on how to better use components. On the main page, there was definitely an overuse of UseStates and not enough use of custom interfaces to better store and call date, and I would have liked to see the search bar function. The favorites button works great though!
Overall I would give the page below par but not far enough below to cause any issue. With some basic fixes it will be great!
